Git is a version control system (VCS) that is incredibly common in today's industry. Even if you're not going to be a programmer, it is worthwhile to learn how to use git. You can use it for anything, not just .c files (though, it has trouble with larger files). For those curious, a git tutorial can be found at http://learngitbranching.js.org/
