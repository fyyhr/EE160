# EE160G
This is the repository shared between the TAs and Jeremy to hold various lab related documents.
 * Lab solutions
 * Grading rubrics
 * Anything that needs to get disseminated to the kids but we'd like to collaborate first.
 
Things on the master branch, I'll push to the EE160 repo that I share with the kids. If you guys also want collab powers on that repo, just ask and I shall grant it.
