Lab 4 Rubric
============

Same as usual, labs will be graded based on if they compile and execute. However, there will be 
points removed for bad formatting and unreadable code. I've also provided more specific grading
criteria. Any file not turned in results in an automatic zero for both compile and execute.

countup.c and countdown.c
-------------------------
 * +1 for compiling
 * +0.2 for documentation
 * +0.2 for correctly printing numbers
 * minimum effort value: 1.6, so basically free 1.6 points here just for turning in the files
 unaltered

temperature.c
-------------
 * +1 for compiling
 * +0.6 for using tocelsius function
 * +0.2 for terminating when user enters '-500'
 * +0.2 for documentation
 * minimum effort value: 1, so get 1 point for turning in Lab 3's temperature.c (if it worked)

temptble.c
----------
 * +1 for compiling
 * +0.6 for using temptable function
 * +0.1 for using tocelsius function correctly
 * +0.1 for terminating when user enters the same value for start and stop
 * +0.2 for documentation
 * minimum effort value: 0.5, if you turn in Lab 3's temperature for this

account.c
---------
 * +1 for compiling
 * +0.2 for using calc\_acc\_amt() function
 * +0.2 for taking user input
 * +0.4 for looping and terminating when user enters 0 for initial amount
 * +0.2 for documentation
 
algorithm
---------
 * +0.5 for turning in per program (total +1 pts)
 * +0.25 for correctness of algorithm
 * +0.25 for algorithm clarity (i.e. can I write the program based on your algorithm)
 * minimum effort value: 0.5, if you turn in something remotely resembling an algorithm
