Lab 5 Rubric
============

Things are getting tougher now! Not only will labs be graded based on wether they compile and execute, a significant amount of points will be gained based on your documentation and algorithm! Additionally, points will be removed for poor formatting. One of the most common formatting mistakes is improper indentation. Vim has a built in solution for this! It's up to you to find it (it's something called auto-indent). More info on specific grading criteria will be released sometime this weekend.
