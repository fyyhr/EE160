Each program will be graded individually

Does the program compile (0-1 with decimals)  

Does the pgoram do what it's supposed to do? (0-1 with decimals)
* Special case with tip_calc.c as it will require formatting the code. I will grade that based on number of excess parentheses. Of the computations, I only have **4** parentheses.

Bonus/penalty multiplier (I mispelled 'multiplier in the Lab2 grading info, ha)  
1.05, 1.00, .90, .50
